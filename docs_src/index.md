title: The sphere eversion project
---
# What is it about?

This project is a formalization the proof of existence of
[sphere eversions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wO61D9x6lNY)
using the [Lean theorem prover](https://leanprover.github.io/), 
mainly developed at [Microsoft Research](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/) 
by [Leonardo de Moura](https://leodemoura.github.io/).
More precisely we formalized the full *h*-principle for open and
ample first order differential relations, and deduce existence of sphere
eversions as a corollary.

The main motivations are:

* Demonstrating the proof assistant can handle geometric topology, and
  not only algebra or abstract nonsense. Note that Fabian Immler and
  Yong Kiam Tan already pioneered this direction by formalizing
  Poincar√©-Bendixon, but this project has much larger scale.
* Exploring new infrastructure for collaborations on formalization
  projects, using the [interactive blueprint](blueprint/index.html).
* Producing a bilingual informal/formal document by keeping the
  blueprint and the formalization in sync.
